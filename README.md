# Game_Of_Life

Two programs to simulate Conway's Game of Life and write data for each evolution to files. cpp_game_of_life.cpp is a serial program that outputs text files of each evolution. cuda_gol.cu is a GPU accelerated version of the former code using Cuda; it also outputs text files of each evolution. A python interpreter and hdf5Helper.py file  process the text files outputted from the C++ code to view data in Paraview.
